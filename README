Yahoo Pipe "twitterfeed"
http://pipes.yahoo.com/vicmortelmans/twitterfeed

HTML front-end where users can start new feeds and link them to their 
twitter-account using twitterfeed.com.

Twitterfeeder input must be either txt or xml.

Providing input as txt

All strings must be on a separate line. No blank lines. Based on startdate 
and frequency (cf. Yahoo Pipe), the strings will gradually be submitted to
the feed. The feed contains only the 10 most recent strings. Once the end 
of the collection is reached, the sequence starts over.

Providing input as xml

All strings must be contained in a <string> node. Each node can have a @time
atribute. The @time attribute contains a number of minutes. The @time 
attributes should be sorted. Based on the startdate, the strings for which 
@time has passed will be submitted to the feed. The feed contains only the 
10 most recent strings. Once the end of the collection is reached, the 
sequence starts over.

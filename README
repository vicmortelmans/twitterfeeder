Twitterfeeder consists of following components.

YQL Open Tables "twittertextfeed", "twitterxmlfeed"
https://github.com/vicmortelmans/yql-tables/tree/master/data

Twittertextfeed keys: startdate, frequency, URL of txt-file

Twitterxmlfeed keys: 

Yahoo Pipe "twitterfeed"
http://pipes.yahoo.com/vicmortelmans/twitterfeed

HTML front-end where users can start new feeds and link them to their 
twitter-account using twitterfeed.com.

Twitterfeeder input must be either txt or xml.

Providing input as txt

All strings must be on a separate line. No blank lines. Based on startdate 
and frequency (cf. Yahoo Pipe), the strings will gradually be submitted to
the feed. The feed contains only the 10 most recent strings. Once the end 
of the collection is reached, the sequence starts over.

Providing input as xml

All strings must be contained in a <string> node. Each node has an @id
atribute. The xml also contains a <idgenerator> node. This contains a javascript
function that takes the current date/time as an argument and generates an id.
